> Flow to follow in interviews: **clarify requirements â†’ list constraints â†’ rough scale â†’ draw HLD â†’ walk through components & data â†’ discuss scaling & trade-offs**.

---

## 1) Design a URL Shortener (Bitly)

### Requirements
- Shorten long URL â†’ short code (e.g., `abc123`).
- Redirect fast.
- Optional: custom alias, link expiry, click analytics, rate limit.

### Constraints / Scale (assume)
- 100M links total, 1B redirects/day, read-heavy.
- Low latency (< 50ms), high availability.

### High-Level
Client â†’ API â†’ App Service â†’ Cache â†’ DB (primary) â†’ Analytics pipeline (async)
+ Background workers for expiry/cleanup.

### Core Components
- API service (create/resolve).
- ID/Code generator (hash + base62, or counter + base62).
- Cache (Redis) for hot redirects.
- DB: Key-Value / NoSQL for `code â†’ longURL, meta`.
- Analytics: Kafka â†’ Stream processor â†’ OLAP store.

### Data Model (NoSQL doc)
- `Link { code, longUrl, createdAt, expiresAt?, ownerId?, clickCount }`
- `ClickEvent { code, ts, ip, ua, ref }` (append-only stream)

### APIs
- `POST /shorten { longUrl, custom?, expiresAt? } -> { code, shortUrl }`
- `GET /:code -> 302 longUrl`
- `GET /stats/:code -> { clicks, ... }`

### Scaling
- Cache hot codes (TTL).
- Read replicas; CDN for redirect response if static 302 allowed.
- Partition by code; pre-generate codes if needed.
- Rate limiting per IP/user.

### Trade-offs
- Hash collisions vs sequential IDs (guessability).
- Strong vs eventual consistency for click counts.
- Cache freshness vs write complexity.

Presence Service, Notification Service, Media Service (S3+CDN),
Queue/Stream (Kafka), Push (FCM/APNs).

### Components
- Connection/Gateway (sticky, token auth).
- Message service (persist, route, ACKs).
- Presence service (last seen, online).
- Delivery worker (fan-out to recipients).

### Data Model
- `Conversation { id, type, members[] }`
- `Message { id, convId, senderId, ts, text|mediaRef, status }`

### APIs/Protocols
- WebSocket events: `SendMessage`, `Delivered`, `Read`, `Typing`.
- REST for history: `GET /conversations/:id/messages?cursor`.
- Signed upload URLs for media.

### Scaling
- Shard by `convId`; ordered writes within shard.
- Write-ahead log; CQRS for search/analytics.
- Fan-out on write vs on read (trade-off based on read patterns).
- Cache recent messages; cold storage for old media.

### Trade-offs
- E2EE vs server-side features (search, moderation).
- Delivery latency vs durability (sync/async replication).

### Components
- Post service, Social graph, Fanout workers.
- Feed generator (per user feed lists).

### Data Model
- `Post { id, authorId, ts, text, mediaRef, metrics }`

- `FeedItem { userId, postId, score, ts }`

### APIs
- `GET /feed?cursor` (returns ranked feed items).
- `POST /post`, `POST /follow`.

### Scaling
- Hot author optimization (celebs): fan-out on read + cache.
- Precompute top-K per user; incremental merges.
- Denormalized counters via streams.
- Media on CDN.

### Trade-offs
- Fan-out on write (fast read, expensive write) vs read.
- Freshness vs ranking compute cost.

### Data Model
- `Video { id, ownerId, metadata, status }`

- `PlayEvent { videoId, ts, position, device }`

### Scaling
- Massive CDN offload; origin shield.
- Chunked segments; prefetch manifests.
- Parallel transcodes; retry/idempotency.

### Trade-offs
- Storage cost vs quality ladder depth.
- Latency to first frame vs encryption/DRM overhead.
